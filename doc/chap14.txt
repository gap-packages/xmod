  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter, which contains details of the major changes to the package as
  it  develops,  was  first created in April 2002. Details of the changes from
  [5XXMod[105X  1 to [5XXMod[105X 2.001 are far from complete. Starting with version 2.009 the
  file [11XCHANGES[111X lists the minor changes as well as the more fundamental ones.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  inspiration  for  this  package  was  the  need,  in the mid-1990's, to
  calculate  induced  crossed  modules  (see  [BW95], [BW96], [BW03]). [5XGAP[105X was
  chosen  over  other  computational group theory systems because the code was
  freely  available,  and  it was possible to modify the Tietze transformation
  code so as to record the images of the original generators of a presentation
  as  words  in  the  simplified  presentation. (These modifications are now a
  standard part of the Tietze transformation package in [5XGAP[105X.)[133X

  [1X14.1-1 [33X[0;0YVersion 1 for [5XGAP[105X[101X[1X 3[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  first  version  of  [5XXMod[105X  became  an  accepted package for [5XGAP[105X 3.4.3 in
  December 1996.[133X
  
  
  [1X14.1-2 [33X[0;0YVersion 2[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YConversion  of  [5XXMod[105X 1 from [5XGAP[105X 3.4.3 to the new [5XGAP[105X syntax began soon after
  [5XGAP[105X  4  was  released,  and  had  a  lengthy  gestation.  The new [5XGAP[105X syntax
  encouraged  a re-naming of many of the function names. An early decision was
  to  introduce  generic  categories  [10X2dDomain[110X  for  (pre-)crossed modules and
  (pre-)cat1-groups, and [10X2dMapping[110X for the various types of morphism. In 2.009
  [10X3dDomain[110X  was  used  for  crossed squares and cat2-groups, and [10X3dMapping[110X for
  their  morphisms.  A  generic  name  for  derivations  and  sections is also
  required, and [10XUp2dMapping[110X is currently used.[133X
  
  
  [1X14.1-3 [33X[0;0YVersion 2.001 for [5XGAP[105X[101X[1X 4[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  was  the  first  version of [5XXMod[105X for [5XGAP[105X 4, completed in April 2002 in
  time  for  the  release of [5XGAP[105X 4.3. Functions for actors and induced crossed
  modules  were  not  included,  nor many of the functions for derivations and
  sections, for example [10XInnerDerivation[110X.[133X
  
  
  [1X14.1-4 [33X[0;0YInduced crossed modules[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YDuring  May  2002  converted  the code for induced crossed modules. (Induced
  cat1-groups may be converted one day.)[133X
  
  
  [1X14.1-5 [33X[0;0YVersions 2.002 -- 2.006[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YVersion  2.004 of April 14th 2004 added the [2XCat1Select[102X ([14X2.7-1[114X) functionality
  of version 1 to the [2XCat1Group[102X ([14X2.4-1[114X) function.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  significant  addition  in  Version  2.005 was the conversion of the actor
  crossed   module   functions   from   the   [11X3.4.4[111X   version.  This  included
  [2XAutomorphismPermGroup[102X  ([14X6.1-1[114X)  for a crossed module; [2XWhiteheadXMod[102X ([14X6.1-2[114X);
  [2XNorrieXMod[102X  ([14X6.1-2[114X);  [2XLueXMod[102X ([14X6.1-2[114X); [2XActorXMod[102X ([14X6.1-2[114X); [2XCentreXMod[102X ([14X4.1-7[114X)
  of a crossed module; [2XInnerMorphism[102X ([14X6.1-3[114X); and [2XInnerActorXMod[102X ([14X6.1-3[114X).[133X
  
  
  [1X14.1-6 [33X[0;0YVersions 2.007 -- 2.010[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThese versions contain changes made between September 2004 and October 2007.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAdded  basic  functions  for  crossed squares, considered as [10X3dObjects[110X
        with  crossed  pairings,  and  their morphisms. Groups with two normal
        subgroups,  and  the  actor  of  a  crossed  module,  provide standard
        examples of crossed squares. (Cat2-groups are not yet implemented.)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YConverted the documentation to the format of the [5XGAPDoc[105X package.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YImproved   [2XAutomorphismPermGroup[102X  ([14X6.1-1[114X)  for  crossed  modules,  and
        introduced a special method for conjugation crossed modules.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSubstantial   revisons   made   to   [2XXModByCentralExtension[102X   ([14X2.1-5[114X);
        [2XNorrieXMod[102X   ([14X6.1-2[114X);   [2XLueXMod[102X   ([14X6.1-2[114X);   [2XActorXMod[102X   ([14X6.1-2[114X);  and
        [2XInducedXModByCopower[102X ([14X7.2-1[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YVersion 2.010, of October 2007, was timed to coincide with the release
        of  [5XGAP[105X  4.4.10,  and included a change of filenames; and correct file
        protection codes.[133X

  [33X[0;0YVersion 2.19, released on 9th June 2012, included the following changes:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  file  [10Xmakedocrel.g[110X  was  copied,  with  appropriate changes, from
        [5XGAPDoc[105X, and now provides the correct way to update the documentation.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe first functions for crossed modules of groupoids were introduced.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YA GNU General Public License declaration was added.[133X
  
  
  [1X14.2-1 [33X[0;0YAllCat1s[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YVersion  [12X2.21[112X  contained  major changes to the [2XCat1Select[102X ([14X2.7-1[114X) operation:
  the  list  [10XCAT1_LIST[110X  of  cat1-structures  in  the  data file [11Xcat1data.g[111X was
  changed  from  permutation  groups  to  pc-groups,  with  the  generators of
  subgroups; images of the tail map; and images of the head map being given as
  [10XExtRepOfObj[110X of words in the generators.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [10XAllCat1s[110X function was reintroduced from the [5XGAP[105X3 version, and renamed as
  the operation [10XAllCat1DataGroupsBasic[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  version  [12X2.25[112X the data in [11Xcat1data.g[111X was extended from groups of size up
  to  [22X48[122X  to groups of size up to [22X70[122X. In particular, the [22X267[122X groups of size 64
  give  rise  to  a total of [22X1275[122X cat1-groups. The authors are indebted to Van
  Luyen  Le  in  Galway  for pointing out a number of errors in the version of
  this list distributed with version [12X2.24[112X of this package.[133X

  [33X[0;0YMajor  changes  in names took place, with [10X2dDomain, 2dGroup, 2dMapping[110X, etc.
  becoming  [10X2DimensionalDomain,  2DimensionalGroup, 2DimensionalMapping[110X, etc.,
  and  similarly  for 3-dimensional versions. Also [10XHigherDimensionalDomain[110X and
